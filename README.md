## Run Ejara Test

Ejara depends on Karee lib.

 - Take a look at [Karee library](https://github.com/ChamplainLeCode/karee)
 - A way to run without [Karee library](https://github.com/ChamplainLeCode/karee) is to first prepare project by running there commands
   - flutter pub get
   - flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
   - flutter run
